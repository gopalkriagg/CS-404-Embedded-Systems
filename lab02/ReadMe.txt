About: Learning how to control input & output through switches and LEDs
My Role: Today I revisited the lab and re-evaulated what we had done and found
there were several major mistakes. I just rewrote all the codes and everything
now works great(or so I think :)
Thoughts: Code was not really that trivial as I had thought earlier. It took some
thinking and learning new concepts like clearInterval() before able to make a 
correct version of the solution.
