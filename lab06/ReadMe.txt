Lab about: Interfacing analog joystick and using it to control etch-a-sketch
My Role: I used my previously made etch-a-sketch with buttons and modified it to work with joystick. I set some threshold on analog values so that sketching experiene is smoother and intuitive. Learnt how joystick actually works - turns out it is pretty simple and lots of innovation lies in its mechanical axes movements. I showed this etch-a-sketch to Sir in his office. I couldn't get my hand on Rotary Encoder though.
