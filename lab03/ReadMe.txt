About: Learning how to perform analog input and output(through PWM) and controlling BBB through a browser. 
My Role: I had revisited the lab few days ago and re-evaulated what we had done and found there were some mistakes. I just rewrote some of the programs and things are working grat now.
Learning outcomes:
1) How to take analog input through analogInput() in bonescript
2) Combining analog input with PWM output in potWithFade.js

Thoughts: This lab was very arduino like! Had fun :)
