1. Go to https://www.debian.org/releases/  and look up what the current stable, testing and unstable realeases are codenamed?
Current Stable Version: Jessie i.e. Debian 8
Current testing version: Stretch
Current unstable version (named as always): Sid

2. Use apt-cache pkgnames to see how many packages are available to install.
Performing apt-cache pkgnames | wc in terminal on bone gives 36685 lines and since each line correspons to a single package name it implies 36685 packages are available to install right now.

APT-GET WAS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO INTERNET. SO, COULDNT COMPLETE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS.

3. Install htop and find what version was installed.
htop version 1.0.1 was installed. (did on my laptop)


4.Follow the directions from class to add the Jessie release packages.  List what you do.
echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie.list
echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-backports main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wheezy-backports.list
apt-get update


5.Use apt-get pkgnames again to see how many packages are now available to install.

6.Install the Jessie release of htop and find what version was installed.
